China claims Tibet as a part of its sovereign territory, known as the Tibet Autonomous Region. China's claim over Tibet is based on historical, cultural, and political factors. According to China, Tibet has been a part of its territory since the 13th century when the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan conquered Tibet. China also argues that Tibet was integrated into the Chinese empire during the Qing Dynasty in the 18th century.

The status of Tibet remains a subject of controversy and is a contentious issue between China and the international community. Many countries have expressed concerns over China's policies in Tibet, including allegations of human rights abuses and suppression of religious and cultural freedoms.
